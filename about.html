                 My name is Sara Denham. I am a third year student athlete at the University of San Francisco. I am pursuing my passion of what I like to call strategic art through an advertising major and design minor. I am the daughter to a Scottish father and Okinawan mother, a dog lover and a woman of faith. I hope my work and my life allows others to see the beauty of Godâ€™s creations and appreciate the beauty of nature. I think life is too short and we are too blessed to let things bring you down or divide us and I hope my work will uplift and bring people together. Growing up in SoCal I always dreamed of working at Disney, which is still something I am very interested in, but I am also passionate about working with nonprofits and small businesses to help them achieve their advertising goals. I have utilized Adobe programs such as Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, and am currently learning about HTML/CSS. I always want to be learning more and improving my skills.
