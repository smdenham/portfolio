                    <p>“New Home” depicts Sara’s first few months in San Francisco. Exploring the city and of course capturing the beauty of the famous bridge that connects the bay to its neighbors. The images background lacks color in order to bring the focus to the foreground where the greeny, teal ocean and vibrant red/orange of the bridge can be fully appreciated.</p>

                    <h1>Don't Judge</h1>
                    <p>The eyes are known as the window into people’s souls and thoughts as well as the body part we use to judge and observe others. Here Sara wanted to emphasize the idea that we can use our eyes to not “judge a book by its cover”. The fiery eye contrasts with the colorless background to bring the focus to the eye and the copy that is in line with it.</p>
